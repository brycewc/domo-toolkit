sidePanel justification:
Enables a persistent companion interface alongside Domo pages. Users can view child pages, navigate page hierarchies, see cards on pages, and access activity logs without leaving their current workflow. The side panel displays contextual information about the current Domo object (page, card, dataset, dataflow) and provides quick actions like copying object IDs, sharing pages, and viewing related objects. This persistent UI is essential for power users who work with complex Domo environments and need constant access to toolkit features without having to constantly open and wait for the popup to load, and not having a big enough surface area to display lists of objects for exploration and administration.
storage justification:
Persists user preferences and extension state across browser sessions. This includes: favicon customization rules (users can set custom favicons per Domo instance to visually distinguish between them), theme preferences (light/dark/system), cookie clearing behavior settings (auto clear on 431 error, or manually clear with a button and which instances to clear cookies for), and cached tab context data for performance (session only). Storage also temporarily holds data passed between extension components (popup to side panel, background to options page) such as activity log filters and page hierarchy results (session only). Favicon cache keys are also stored for performance (local only).
scripting justification:
This is essential for the extension's core functionality. It enables the extension to: (1) detect the current Domo object by reading URL patterns and page state, (2) fetch object details using Domo's authenticated session by executing API calls in the page context, (3) update browser tab titles to show meaningful object names instead of generic "Domo" titles and custom favicon rules, and (4) access Domo's internal bootstrap data for features like cookie management. The extension executes scripts exclusively on domo.com domains and uses the page's existing authentication - it never stores or transmits credentials. This also means that users only maintain the access they already have set in that Domo instance, not allowing them to do anything they couldn't already do.
activeTab justification:
Works in conjunction with the scripting permission to enable context detection on the user's current Domo tab and to run scripts in the correct tab so they are in the correct Domo instance.
clipboardRead justification:
Enables the "Navigate to Copied Object" feature, a key productivity tool for Domo administrators. Users frequently copy Domo object IDs from messaging apps, documentation, support tickets, or other sources. The extension reads the clipboard to detect valid Domo object IDs (numeric IDs or UUIDs), then allows users to instantly navigate to that object or view its details. Clipboard access only occurs for use on domo.com pages and the extension validates that clipboard content matches Domo ID patterns before processing. Clipboard data never persists longer than a session, nor is it stored when the clipboard data doesn't match a Domo ID pattern.
clipboardWrite justification:
Enables the "Copy ID" feature, allowing users to quickly copy the current Domo object's ID to their clipboard with one click or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+1). Domo power users frequently need to share object IDs with colleagues, use them inside of Domo searches or configurations, paste them into support tickets, or reference them in documentation. This feature eliminates the need to manually extract IDs from URLs, which is especially valuable for complex URL structures like dataset UUIDs or card modals where the object ID isn't available in the URL.
cookies justification:
Enables intelligent session cookie management for Domo instances. Domo users who work across multiple instances frequently encounter HTTP 431 "Request Header Fields Too Large" errors when accumulated session cookies exceed browser limits. This is because Domo stores their cookies in a longer format and their DA-SID cookies at the root domain, so they get passed to every instance. The extension provides different cookie clearing methods set by user preference: (1) one-click clearing of all Domo cookies, (2) selective clearing that preserves sessions for the 2 most recent and currently open instances (default), and (3) automatic 431 detection then clearing Domo cookies with the same maintained rule of 2 most recent and currently open instance. Cookie access is restricted to domo.com domains only. Their name is only access to make root level DA-SID cookies so some can be maintained. The values of the cookie are never read or stored.
webNavigation justification:
Enables context detection during Domo's single-page application (SPA) navigation. Domo sometimes uses client-side routing, so standard page load events don't fire when users the navigates within the application. The extension listens for history state changes (onHistoryStateUpdated) to detect when users navigate to different Domo objects, then automatically updates the extension's context and tab titles. This listener is filtered to domo.com URLs only and does not monitor navigation on any other websites.
webRequest justification:
Enables automatic detection and resolution of HTTP 431 errors, a common pain point for Domo power users. When users work across multiple Domo instances, accumulated session cookies can exceed HTTP header size limits, causing 431 "Request Header Fields Too Large" errors that render Domo unusable until cookies are cleared. The extension monitors responses from domo.com domains for 431 status codes and can automatically clear excess cookies while preserving the user's two most recent, open sessions. This feature is optional and can be enable in the extension options (it is not the default). When not enabled, this permission is not used. The listener only monitors main frame requests to domo.com domain and only ever does anything with 431 errors. No other information about or in these requests is read or stored.
Host permission justification:
The host permission _://_.domo.com/\* restricts all extension functionality exclusively to Domo domains. This permission is essential for core functionality: inject content scripts for favicon customization and context detection, execute scripts in page context to use user's session to authenticate to Domo's APIs, manage Domo session cookies, and monitor navigation within Domo's SPA. By limiting host permissions this domain, the extension ensures it cannot access, modify, or monitor any websites outside the Domo platform. This narrow scope protects user privacy while enabling the full range of Domo-specific productivity features, fully understood and opted into by the user.
