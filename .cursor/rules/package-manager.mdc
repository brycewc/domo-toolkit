# Package Manager

Always use `yarn` instead of `npm` for all package management commands:

- `yarn` instead of `npm install`
- `yarn add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`
- `yarn remove <package>` instead of `npm uninstall <package>`
- `yarn dev` instead of `npm run dev`
- `yarn build` instead of `npm run build`
